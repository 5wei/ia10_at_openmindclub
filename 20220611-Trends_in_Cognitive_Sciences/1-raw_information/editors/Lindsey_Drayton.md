> Lindsey Drayton received her PhD from Yale University, where she studied the cognitive capacities of humans and other species. Her work focused primarily on understanding the kinds of representations that rhesus macaques use in social contexts and how these representations might serve as the building blocks of humanâ€™s theory of mind capacities. She also studied how very distantly related species, such as cleaner fish, solve complex social problems, and worked with clinical psychologists to characterize theory of mind deficits in psychopathic criminal offenders. She joined Cell Press in 2017.
